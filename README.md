# RRC InfoSec Workshop Documents

This repository has documents and support docs for Red River College Tech Camps, Open House and other public facing information sessions relating to Information Security.

## Getting Started

You can find files on how to engage in basic activities, and how to create your own environment.  Any questions, email sjay@rrc.ca

### Prerequisites

You will need a virtual environment.  I recommend you use VirtualBox. 

You will also need vulnerable systems.  We start with Metasploitable 2, but there are other systems available.  Check out [vulnhub](https://vulnhub.com), or search google with the following:

## Built With

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads/) - Recommended virtualization environment
* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) - Pentest tools.  I recommend the Xfce 64 bit version
* [Metasploitable 2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/latest/download) - An incredibly vulnerable instance of Linux
